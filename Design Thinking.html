<div class="div1"><h2>R2:Introduction to design and Thinking Process</h2>
	<p>After I learned the Design and thinking process there is a lot of things changes in my
mind when it comes in designing, I realized that design is not only a design to have a beautiful
look of product or something, in this topic I learned the importance of the design in problem
solving, design thinking help me to have a better solution in problem solving. As a student I
already used some design like in programming design is also important in programming it helps
me to solve the problem in easiest way and also by having an efficient code. But when it comes
to User design, it has a difference because creating a website not just only designing to make it
attractive to user but it also need a purpose on why this website has this kind of design and it
also connected to the function in the website, that will help the user used the website easily
and easy to access. I’ve learned that having a good design will help you to simply solve the
solution weather it is user design or programming, this design thinking process was useful to
me as a student who’s doing a program because I’ve realized that this design thinking process is
not only for user design but also in other forms of problem solving.
