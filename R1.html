<div class="div1"><h2>R1:My first few weeks of USERDES Class </h2>
	<p><b><br>Week 1<br></b><p>To our first meeting I was feel excited and nervous not because it has a recitation but because maybe my connection will disconnect, and I’m glad that is not. When the class was started we talk about our favorite application, what the design is? When Miss discussing about on what we talk about I feel more excited in this subject because I really want to learn to design a website.<p>
	<p>When I see the first activity that Miss given to us it makes me think that those activity has a connection to our topic that will be discuss, and one of my first experience in the first week of USERDES is when we create a simple website. This part was very challenging to me because I’ve experienced a few error when I upload it to my Heroku, some of the fonts and background didn’t work, but I fixed it because of the help of one of my classmate. Even though I’m having a hard time to fix that I’ve learn a lot on how can I fixed the problem.</p><b>Week 2</b><p>In the second week of our meeting the very challenging part to me is the puzzle the userinyerface it was fun but I’m panicking that time because some of my classmate already submit their screenshot while I’m still solving the puzzle, a few later of class session a passed.</p><p>When Miss mention that userinyerface was a also a kind of UX design, I become curious about that it makes me think how they do that?  I was interested to learn that kind of design because the user makes think on how they solve the puzzle. There is one thing that I’ve realized about UI/UX design that it is not about just designing the web it should also has a purpose and how the user will enjoy the website that I create.</p><p>For the topic that discussed in this week, about the persona I’m slightly didn’t get it at first because it was new to me and that time I’m having a poor internet connection, but since the call was recorded I just watched it and also the linked video that Miss provide, it helps me to gets on how can I make a personas, I just think about what is the good persona that I will create. I do some research for my persona to look it more really. </p> <b>Week 3</b><p>The discussion in the week 3 was about the design there is a lot of things that I’ve learned here, design is not only a design that the people will see in the website. there is something that I remember in our week three session that everything has a design and that design has a purpose, on why it design liked that, and it makes me realize that when I’m going to design my website it should have a purpose like, why I choose this kind of color, why my layout look like this and etc. because design is not only to attract the user, it should be on how easy to understand and use the website by the user. Not only the front of the website should have a good design but also the back of it, which is the code.</p><p>Conclusion
	In conclusion, in this three week of our meeting there is a lot of things that I’ve learned and I know that my first work is not good as I expect, but after I gain a new knowledge want to improve my work to look it more presentable and when a create my final portfolio. I’ve been enjoying and looking forward to make a portfolio by applying all the skills that I’ve learned so that I can used it for my future.
