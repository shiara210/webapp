<div class="div1"><h2>R4:Information Architecture</h2>
	<p>There is a lot of thigs I’ve learned in this topic, even though this is not the part of our
syllabus it was a helpful topic that I can apply to my projects to have a good design for my
websites and use a proper design that has a purpose to have a good website design. After the
discussion of this topic it helps me to think of what I’m going to add or improve to my personal
website since half of it is done and the things that I want to improve to my website is the
navigation bar I’ve learned in the topic that home page is not important and I want to make a
changes for that. The important things that I’ve learned in information architecture is to think
better for the user of the website, the architecture of the website is not only a design to look
attractive to the user the purpose of this information architecture is to have a better user
interaction where in the user can easily use the website and they can easily found what they
searching for. I want to apply this lesson to my personal website, because I challenge myself to
create my own style for my website and the information of the topic was a great help to
improve my project and also to our group project.</p>
