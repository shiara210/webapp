		<h1>G1:What is User Design</h1>
		<h3>What is Design?</h3><p>Design is the process that used to create products that provide meaningful and relevant experience to users. It involves the entire process of acquiring and integrating the product that includes aspects of branding, design usability and function.<h3>What is user design?</h3><p>User Design is an experience on how’s the user feel or if it’s easy to used so that the user can easily accomplish their desired task and the goal of this design is to create easy, efficient, relevant and all- around  pleasant experience for the user.</p><h3>What is difference between user experience design and user interface design? Why does it matter?</h3><p>User experience design is how a person feels when interfacing with a system, while user interface design focus on what users might need to do with an interface that are easy to access, understand and use of facilitate those action. These two are important because having a good user interface design can catch the attention of the visitors’ and in the user experience design it aims to provide positive experiences that keep a user loyal to the product or brand.</p>
		<h3>Who are the users? Why are they important?</h3><p>User is a person who utilize a computer or network service. Users are important because they are the one who will test the websites if it’s easy to use to identify any friction they might face when interacting with it.</p></p>

    <h1>G2:What is Design Thinking</h1>
    <p>Design thinking is a kind of process for creative problem solving that leads to a better
	products, by the help of design thinking it helps the human to identify an alternative
	strategies and provide a solution based on the problem solving.</p>
	<p>According to the Website of <i>(Interaction Design Foundation)</i> Design thinking need a
	deep interest in developing to understand the people whom we’re designing the products or
	services. Design Thinking helps us in the process of questioning: questioning the problem,
	questioning the assumptions, and questioning the implications. Design Thinking is extremely
	useful in tackling problems that are ill-defined or unknown, by re-framing the problem in
	human-centric ways, creating many ideas in brainstorming sessions, and adopting a hands-on
	approach in prototyping and testing. Design Thinking also involves ongoing
	experimentation: sketching, prototyping, testing, and trying out concepts and ideas. The
	importance of design thinking for solving a problem is prioritizing the consumers need on
	how the people will interact with their environments to create innovation solution in this
	creative technique the designer will see how the people use a product or service and they will
	continue to improve the product to have a good user experience.</p>
	<p>After searching on what is design thinking I realized the importance of this technique
	when creating a website because it will help the designer to identify the problem and what is
	the possible solution that need to do. I want to learn more about this and I want to apply it for
	our project because I know that it was a big help to our group by using this kind of
	techniques. </p>

    <h1>G3:What is Prototype</h1>
    <p>Prototype it’s a preliminary model or design of a product that will be develop. Websites
	prototype is an interactive demo for a project cycle that gather feedback to improve the
	website before to build a final development of a project.
	
	<p>When it comes to a design prototype serves as a basis for future model of a websites. It
	helps the designer or the developer to create a new design and test it to confirm the
	functionality of a products in the production. Prototype can help the developer to get a
	feedback from the user before the actual project and it has a many benefits According to the
	website of <i>(Technopedia)</i> it explained here the benefits of the prototype first, is the basic
	requirements it determined the input and output data needed, second is initial prototype
	creation, third is the review the client and the end user will verify prototype and valuable
	feedback if there is a necessary changes in the final product, Lastly the Revise and improve
	prototype by the help of the client and end user prototype can be change accordingly and
	improved. The advantage of prototype it allow the use to see what is the final product will look
	like, the reason why prototyping is important to do is because it will see here what is in and out
	of scope to support the project and also to test the design regarding to the layout of the
	website, also the advantage of prototype is gathering the feedback through usability testing
	where it is constantly refined. </p>
	<p>The difference of low and high fidelity are, low fidelity is a quick and easy way to
	translate high –level design concepts. The important role of this lo-fi is to check and test the
	functionality rather than visual appearance. The example of this low fidelity is paper
	prototyping it allow the digital product interface without using digital software, it will just
	creating hand drawings of different screen that represent the user interface of a product. It is a
	simple technique that can be useful for production team to explore different ideas and design.
	While the High fidelity has appear function as similar to the possible outcomes of the project. It
	usually create when the teams has a solid understanding of what they are going to build and
	need to test with the user and get final design approval from their stakeholders. The example of
	this high fidelity is digital prototype since there is a lot of specialized software that allows the
	designer to create a powerful prototype with interactives effects. According to the blog of Nick
	Babich a code prototype is a solution that is pretty close to the ready-to-release version of a product.
	An example of such prototype would be a rich interactive sandbox that allows test participants to
	explore a product’s different features.</p>
	<p>The importance of a prototype, since is a part of UX process it will help the developer and the
	designer to get a feedback from the user to make sure that the website was in the good direction. It will
	help them to fix the areas that need to improve base on the feedback of the user and the developers
	will know what they need to remove or improved. By the help of prototype this can be save an amount
	of money and time to develop a project in addition the prototype of a website can be helpful for the
	designer and developer since functional specification document is difficult to interpret, but by the help
	of a prototype it allows them to visualize what is needed in the project.</p>
