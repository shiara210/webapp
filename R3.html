<div class="div1"><h2>R3:Need Finding (Design Problem)</h2>
	<b><br>Week 1</br></b><p>In this week I felt slightly nervous when the leader are the one who will choose their members
and it was funny at the same time because I think that maybe there’s no one will choose me, but I’m
glad that I will be the one who will choose my group and I’m glad that I choose the right group for
myself. So after the discussion we already set a meeting to talk and discuss on what will become our
problem for the presentation next week on that time, so what happened in our first meeting is our
leader is the one who will speak while I reply in the chat because I can’t find my earphone o that time
and it was a challenge to us to think a problem for our group but eventually we already think on what is
our problem which is the transportation we agreed that this will be our final topic. After we finalized it
we already to our power point and practice our presentation for the next week of that time.</p>

<br><b>Week 2</b></br><p>Week 2 is our presentation for our chosen problem, we also have another practice in this day
and after that we talk on who will share the screen and we agreed to each other that just one who will
share their screen after that, the presentation was started and we are the fourth presenter in the
seventh group. When we were close to present I feel nervous because it might be suddenly have a
problem in my internet connection or have a background noise but I’m thankful that it did not happen
and our presentation became good. After the presentation and get the feedbacks of our classmate and
Ms. Jen, we didn’t have a meeting because of connection problem but after a few days we already had a
meeting and talk about on what we need to change or update in our power point and we also do our
storyboard.</p>
<br><b>Week 3</b><br><p>In this week we have asynchronous class because of the internet problem on that week we just
present our presentation to other groups and give some feedback for the improvement of our work and
we also give a feedback for to other group. As I see the feedback of other groups to our work it was nice
to read that most of our work was ok and the only thing that they suggest is to have a title in our story
board to understand it clearly. I was glad to know that we had a few changes to fix our presentation it
was a relief for me because this is a busy week there is so much assignment and project that we need to
submit.</p>
<p>But even though it’s a busy week we already finished our presentation and also the other
assignment in other subjects, after we talk about our presentation, we talk to each other on how’s our
online class and more, this was an exhausting week but it has a lot of fun.</p></br>
