<div class="div1"><h2>R5:Introduction to design and Thinking Process</h2>
	<p>In the asynchronous session there is an activity that we need to improve to make it more
		presentable and readable, but in the next topic that we discussed I realize here the importance of the
		design that I create in the last activity. Visual information design makes me understand on why it need
		the invitation correctly that attendees or reader can understand what the card says, when I doing my
		invitation card I think about on how the readers will understand the information easily and I used one to
		three colors only for the title and information. I was glad that I done it correctly after Ms. Jen discussed
		the visual information there is a lot of things I learned here and I there is one thing that I’ve realized
		when on comes to font style in my observation when you see the font style it looks all the same but if
		you will observe it there are some details that was different to each of them and using simple font style
		can look goods like in the example in the power point which is the cover page of the book. I also learned
		here the color combination it gives me an idea on how can I combine the colors for my websites,
		because I have difficulties to choose a right color for my website it also gives me an idea to search in the
		internet regarding the color combination and I was glad that I found a website that will help me to
		choose a nice color for my website (color hunt).</p>
		<p>After the discussion of these topic I really enjoy our activities and also the website because
			there is a lot of things I’ve learned and I really understand how the code works in html and CSS because I
			create my own design and I can apply the things I’ve learned in this topic for my project.</p>
